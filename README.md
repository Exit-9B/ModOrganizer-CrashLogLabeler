# Crash Log Tools for Mod Organizer
These are plugins for [Mod Organizer 2](https://www.modorganizer.org/) that
provide extra functionality for the Skyrim crash logs generated by
[Crash Logger](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59596).

## Plugins
### Crash Log Labeler
Attempts to label known functions in the call stack by looking them up from
[Address Library Database](https://github.com/meh321/AddressLibraryDatabase).

When you start Mod Organizer with the plugin installed, it will pull the
database and try to update any crash logs already in your log directory. If
your game crashes thereafter, it will scan for a new log file and try to update
it as well.

If you wish to restore the original logs, they can be found in the Recycle Bin.

### Crash Log Viewer
Adds a GUI dialog that allows you to easily access your crash logs.

The tool can be started from the Tool Plugins menu.

## Packaging from source
External libraries need to be acquired and installed to the `lib` subdirectory
of the plugin.
```
git clone https://github.com/Exit-9B/ModOrganizer-CrashLogTools
cd ModOrganizer-CrashLogTools
pip install -r plugin-requirements.txt -t crashlogtools/lib
```

## Installation
The scripts should be installed to a subdirectory in the Mod Organizer plugins
folder. The resulting folder hierarchy should be
`<MO2 DIR>\plugins\crashlogtools`
