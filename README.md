# Crash Log Labeler for Mod Organizer
This is a plugin for [Mod Organizer 2](https://www.modorganizer.org/) that scans
Skyrim crash logs generated by
[Crash Logger](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59596) and
attempts to label functions in the call stack using
[Address Library Database](https://github.com/meh321/AddressLibraryDatabase).

## Installation
First, external libraries need to be acquired:
```
pip -r plugin-requirements.txt -t lib
```

Then the files should be installed to a subdirectory in the Mod Organizer
plugins folder. The resulting folder hierarchy should be something like
`<MO2 DIR>\plugins\crashloglabeler`.

## Usage
When you start Mod Organizer with the plugin installed, it will pull the
database and try to update any crash logs already in your log directory. If
your game crashes thereafter, it will scan for a new log file and try to update
it as well.

If you wish to restore the original logs, they can be found in the Recycle Bin.
